# Synopsis
Campus Map is an application the Infrastructure team can use to inventory sites, network closets, and network objects.  It's intent is to provide insight to the gear we manage, where it lives, and how it connects.  This will replace the various rogue Excel files and Power BI dashboards with a centralized repository of Infrastructure equipment.

Additionally, this can be a valuable training tool for new Infrastructure staff as it should showcase the layout of Infrastructure in an easily identifiable manner.
